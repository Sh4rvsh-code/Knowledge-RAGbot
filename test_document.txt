This is a sample document about Python programming.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

Key features of Python include:
- Easy to learn syntax
- Dynamic typing
- Automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library
- Support for multiple programming paradigms

Python is widely used for:
1. Web development (Django, Flask)
2. Data science and machine learning (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
3. Automation and scripting
4. Scientific computing

The philosophy of Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, as expressed in "The Zen of Python":
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex

Python 3 is the current version and is actively maintained. Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020.
